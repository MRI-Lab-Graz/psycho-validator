# Proposed Additional Modalities for Psychology Institute

Based on the research areas at the University of Graz Psychology Institute, here are proposed additional schemas.

## 1. EEG (Electroencephalography)
Target Areas: Biological Psychology, Cognitive Science

Use Cases: Event-related potentials, frequency analysis, sleep research

Technical Parameters: Channel count, sampling rate, filtering, impedance

Study Parameters: Paradigm type, trigger events, baseline periods

## 2. Eyetracking
Target Areas: General Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Cognitive Science

Use Cases: Visual attention, reading research, scene perception

Technical Parameters: Sampling rate, accuracy, calibration method

Study Parameters: AOI definitions, fixation criteria, saccade parameters

## 3. Questionnaire/Survey
Target Areas: All departments (questionnaire-heavy discipline)

Use Cases: Personality assessment, clinical scales, attitude measures

Technical Parameters: Response format, item count, administration mode

Study Parameters: Construct validity, reliability coefficients, normative data

## 4. Behavioral/Performance
Target Areas: Work & Organizational Psychology, Experimental Psychology

Use Cases: Reaction time tasks, cognitive assessments, performance tests

Technical Parameters: Response accuracy, timing precision, input method

Study Parameters: Task difficulty, cognitive load, experimental design

## 5. Physiological
Target Areas: Biological Psychology, Health Psychology

Use Cases: Stress research, emotion regulation, psychophysiology

Technical Parameters: Sensor type (GSR, HR, EMG), sampling specifications

Study Parameters: Baseline measurement, stressor application, recovery periods

## 6. Social Interaction
Target Areas: Social Psychology, Developmental Psychology

Use Cases: Group dynamics, interpersonal behavior, social cognition

Technical Parameters: Recording format, interaction medium, synchronization

Study Parameters: Group size, social roles, manipulation checks

## 7. Clinical Assessment
Target Areas: Clinical Psychology, Health Psychology

Use Cases: Diagnostic interviews, therapy outcome measures, screening tools

Technical Parameters: Assessment duration, scoring method, administration format

Study Parameters: Diagnostic criteria, severity measures, treatment response

## 8. Virtual Reality/Digital
Target Areas: Digital Technologies and Psychology

Use Cases: VR experiments, digital interventions, immersive environments

Technical Parameters: Hardware specifications, tracking accuracy, rendering quality

Study Parameters: Presence measures, cybersickness, interaction paradigms

## Implementation Priority Suggestions
1. High Priority: Questionnaire, Behavioral, EEG (common in research)
2. Medium Priority: Eyetracking, Physiological (specialized equipment)
3. Future Expansion: Social, Clinical, VR (emerging methodologies)

## Schema Design Principles
- Hierarchical Structure: Technical → Study → Categories → Metadata
- Extensible: Allow for domain-specific extensions
- Interoperable: Cross-reference between modalities
- Versioned: Support for methodology evolution
- Searchable: Rich metadata for database queries
